(1) Maintaining this file hw9.txt

(2) While currently in the modified diffutils directory, I used the git 
    checkout command, and created a new branch named "quote":

$ git checkout v3.0 -b quote

(3) I then installed my change to this new branch by patching my patch
    quote-3.0-patch.txt with the patch command:

$ patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

(4) I learned how to use the Emacs function add-change-log-entry-other-window

(5) Using the previous function, I composed an appropriate ChangeLog entry
    for the patch for each of the 6 modified files, and added the message that
    I changed the grave accents to apostrophes:

$ emacs src/cmp.c
C-x 4-a

    The same process was done for the other 5 files

(6) I then committed my changes to the new branch via the git add command.
    I used a second command git commit -F to apply a message to the commit
    with my Changelog message:

$ git add .
$ git commit -F ChangeLog

(7) I then used the format-patch git command to generate a file formatted-
    patch.txt:

$ git format-patch -1 --stdout > ../formatted-patch.txt

(8) I then verified that my partner's patch worked. I first checked out
    version 3.0 again in a new branch called partner, and applied the patch
    with the git am command. I then built the resulting system, and checked
    to make sure that it worked with make check:

$ git checkout v3.0 -b partner
$ git am [formatted-patch-partner.txt]

    It said that the patch was applied with my partner's corresponding name
    and email. I then built the system as was done in the lab portion for 
    step 13:

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

    As a final check, to make sure that my partner's patch worked properly,
    I ran the original command (i.e. diff . -), and as desired, the output 
    was formatted properly (i.e. ' ', instead of the `')

(9) I then verified that my ChangeLog entry worked by running the make distdir
    command. This command created a directory called diffutils-3.0.1-2608. I
    entered this directory, and looked at the ChangeLog. The first entry was
    the entry that I had just created:

2017-03-12  Jason Andrew Less  <less@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

        2017-03-12 Jason Andrew Less <less@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>
                * src/util.c: Changed grave accent to apostrophe

                * src/sdiff.c: Changed grave accent to apostrophe

                * src/dir.c: Changed grave accent to apostrophe

                * src/diff3.c: Changed grave accent to apostrophe

                * src/diff.c: Changed grave accent to apostrophe

                * src/cmp.c: Changed grave accent to apostrophe

(10) I then tried to get a copy of the GNU Emacs git repository's master branch
     on the SEASnet server in the directory ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs. However,
     this directory didn't seem to exist, so I went to the link provided, and
     retrieved a copy of the Emacs repository from Savannah. As I already had
     Xquartz downloaded, I was set to use gitk. I navigated into the emacs
     directory after it downloaded, and then used the gitk command:

$ git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git
$ cd emacs
$ gitk

     Emacs opened up in Xquartz, and I scrolled down to 2015-01-25 to find
     the newest merge that is not newer than the date stated previously. I
     found it, clicked on it, and then took a screenshot of my view of the 
     mergepoint.
