- To begin this lab, I signed onto the SEASNet Server via my terminal:

$ ssh [username]@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
[password]

- Once on the SEASNet Server, I downloaded coreutils-7.6 into the home 
  directory via wget:

$ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

- I then untarred and unzipped the file:

$ tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

- After that, I created a directory called "coreutilsInstall" in my 
home directory:

$ mkdir coreutilsInstall

- I then navigated into the coreutils-7.6 directory to read the INSTALL file on
   how to configure the script with the appropriate flags

$ cd coreutils-7.6
$ emacs INSTALL

- After learning the proper syntax for configuring it into the 
  proper directory, I looked up the full path name of the current 
  working directory using pwd:

$ pwd

- I then ran the configure script to configure coreutils-7.6 into the 
  new directory:

$ ./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/less/coreutilsInstall

- Next, I compiled and installed the directory into the coreutilsInstall 
  directory, and then navigated to that directory:

$ make
$ make install
$ cd coreutilsInstall

- Once in the coreutilsInstall directory, change directory to the 
  bin subdirectory:

$ cd bin

- Then, I ran the ls command using ./ls -l to show the list of the
   directories to see the bug in the file date:
  (e.g. -rwxr-xr-x 1 less csugrad  96056 2017-01-26 00:33 uname)

$ ./ls -l

- Brady's patch was applied to fix the bug by changing directories back
   to the coreutils-7.6 directory, and using Emacs to paste the patch into
    file patchFile:

$ cd ~/coreutils-7.6
$ emacs patchFile

- The patch was then applied via the patch command with input as the patchFile:

$ patch -p1 < patchFile

- Use of make again to rebuild the patched ls.c:

$ make

- The following was output:

- make all-recursive => used to recursively double check with the new 
  make if any new files require compilation (after the patch was applied)
- making all in src => it was found that there was a change to make in the src 
  (only in the src a change needed to be applied as it was the only one
   that didn't specify "Nothing to...")

- Then to make sure that the patch fixed the bug, I changed directory and 
  checked both versions (old and new) for ls by creating two files via touch:

$ cd ~/coreutilsInstall/bin
$ touch file
$ touch -t 201501011205.09 file2
$ ls -l and $ ./ls -l

- The patch did work and the file date was outputted like desired
  (e.g. -rwxr-xr-x 1 less csugrad  96008 Jan 26 01:12  uname)
